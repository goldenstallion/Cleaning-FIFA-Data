Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting or removing any errors or inconsistencies in a dataset. This involves removing duplicate records, correcting incorrect or incomplete data, identifying missing values, and ensuring that the data is formatted consistently. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is as accurate, complete, and reliable as possible, and to eliminate any errors or inconsistencies that could potentially affect the quality of the analysis or insights. It is an important step in the data analysis process as it helps to ensure that the insights derived from the data are reliable and trustworthy.

Data cleaning is a fundamental process and might take up 70 - 80% time when handling data.
